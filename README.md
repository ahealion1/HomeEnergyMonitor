# Home Energy Monitor

A repository for my Final Year Project; a Home Energy Monitor.

The goal of this project is to accurately identify home appliances through the use of audio recording and use this information to estimate each appliances home energy usage. This would enable homeowners to easily and cost-effectively account for their appliances' approximate energy usage.

The project was written through MATLAB.
